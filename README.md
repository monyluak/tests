# :person_fencing: Tests

> evaluate and verify software

### :nerd_face: Why test?

- Confirm software behaves as **intended** by verifying requirements and **edge cases**.
- Detect **bugs** and ensure changes don't introduce new bugs or **break** existing functionality.
- Facilitate code **refactoring** by providing confidence that **changes** don't introduce new bugs.
- Improve software **quality** by catching issues early and making it more **reliable** and robust.
- Speed up development by allowing developers to quickly **verify** changes don't break existing **functionality**.

### Types of tests
1. **Unit tests**
  - Assess individual functions or classes by supplying input and making sure the output is as expected.
  > Unit tests are like a treasure hunt for bugs!
2. **Integration tests**
  - Check how different parts of a system work together and ensure they are integrated correctly.
  > Integration tests are like a puzzle, where all the pieces fit together perfectly to create a complete and functional system.
3. **UI tests**
  - Analyze the user interface of an application, simulating user interactions and testing the application's behavior.
  > UI tests are like being a customer, where you get to try out the application and make sure it works as expected and is easy to use before it's released to the public.
